# CoRE Hacks Project
## Simple Graph and Node classes
### Nicholas Reyes

## Brief Description

* This is just the start of a greater project I have in mind for maybe the summer

* I have made some fairly basic code for the basis of a graph; classes for graphs and nodes in particular

* I am hoping to eventually add a class or representation for weighted edges so that I can effectively implement Dijkstra's Algorithm to find paths between nodes
